        <br> <p>The peacock feather (Athene noesios) is a secret symbol of Lord Krishna. Lord Krishna is the divine incarnation of love and compassion. The peacock feather is often associated with Lord Krishna because of its radiant colors and its ability to create beautiful, vibrant patterns in the air.

            The peacock feather can also be seen as a symbol of royalty and power. When Lord Krishna was crowning himself with a peacock feather, he was declaring himself to be royalty and ruler of the universe. Similarly, when a queen or princess wears a peacock feather in her hair, she is declaring herself to be powerful and influential.
            The peacock is the most exquisite bird in the world because of its vibrant feathers and colour.
            The peacock is the national bird of India and national pride for all of its citizens.
            Peacocks mainly thrive by eating plants and small animals and are one of the largest birds in the country.
            You can find peacocks all over the country. They can be seen pecking the ground for food and on the tall trees in the forest.<br><br>
            Peacocks are the males in this species of bird. The females are called peahens. They do not have elaborate feathers like the males.
            The peacocksâ€™ feathers have hundreds of eye-like patterns used to attract females and ward off predators.
            Peacocks are often found in close proximity to human settlements, but they are shy birds.
            Although these birds can fly, they spend most of their time running on the ground.
            Hunters used to hunt peacocks extensively before being protected under the Wildlife Protection Act of 1972.
            Peacocks have a lifespan of around 10 to 25 years.</p>
