        <p>The peacock feather (Athene noesios) is a secret symbol of Lord Krishna. Lord Krishna is the divine incarnation of love and compassion. The peacock feather is often associated with Lord Krishna because of its radiant colors and its ability to create beautiful, vibrant patterns in the air.

            The peacock feather can also be seen as a symbol of royalty and power. When Lord Krishna was crowning himself with a peacock feather, he was declaring himself to be royalty and ruler of the universe. Similarly, when a queen or princess wears a peacock feather in her hair, she is declaring herself to be powerful and influential.</p><br>
